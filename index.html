<p>The project supports the saving of gaze data taken by EyeTribe tracker. The main features are:</p>

<h3>
<a id="saving-the-data-in-csv-file" class="anchor" href="#saving-the-data-in-csv-file" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Saving the data in .csv file</h3>

<ol>
<li>Gaze location</li>
<li>Mouse location</li>
<li>Information about key and mouse button presses<br>
</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>Saving the user screen</li>
<li>Adding the gaze location to the frames</li>
<li>Adding gaze history to the frame</li>
<li>Adding visualization of cursor location and mouse clicks.</li>
</ol>

<a id="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h1>

<p>Before starting the application, it's necessary to calibrate the eye tracker using the producer software.
After launching the application, user is presented with a small window with a button for starting the recording, as well as possibility to choose the location of output files in the top menu.
After starting the recording, the user has the possibility to temporarily pause the recording or stop it. After stopping the recording or exiting the applications the output files appear in specified folder. </p>

<a id="code" class="anchor" href="#code" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Code</h1>

<p>The files are organized using the MVC pattern. It's generally possible to understand the class purpose by it's name.</p>

<ul>
<li>DataController - Manages the processing the data received from the eye tracker and saving it in .csv file</li>
<li>FileController - Manages more complex operations concerning files</li>
<li>ImageEditor - Controlls the drawing of the gazes and mouse cursor on the captured screen</li>
<li>KeyLogger - Captures the keyboard and mouse button presses during the recording</li>
<li>MovieController - Manages assembling the movie from capured images</li>
<li>ScreenCaptureController - Controls the main loop of the application</li>
</ul>

<a id="unfinished-features" class="anchor" href="#unfinished-features" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Unfinished features</h1>

<p>On the text-recognition branch we kept the work concerning the checking the line of text which is looked at by the user.
The TextBlockMarker class handles the recognition of text lines on the image, and although not working perfectly it gives quite good results.
Then in the Test class we examined the usability of Tesseract library for optical text recognition. The final results aren't good enough. If we were to work on the project farther, going through the complicated process of training the Tesseract library would be a good start.</p>
